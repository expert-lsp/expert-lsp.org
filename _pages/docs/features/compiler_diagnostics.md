Expert provides fast compiler diagnostics as you type, showing errors and warnings directly in your editor.

It compiles the file you are currently editing as you type, and reports any issues it finds.
Once a file is saved, Expert will also compile the entire project in the background to ensure that all diagnostics are up to date.
