Expert can be developed and built with any elixir+otp versions, it doesn't matter if they're different from the ones used in your projects.

When you open a project, Expert will automatically detect the elixir and otp versions you have installed for that project, and it will
build itself using those versions to provide the best compatibility.

This way, you don't have to worry about waiting for Expert to support the latest elixir or otp versions, as long as you have them installed
locally, Expert will use them.
