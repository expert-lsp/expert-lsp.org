A code action is a context-aware change that can be applied to your code. For example, fixing a problem or refactoring code.

Expert includes the full refactoring suite from [RefactorEx](https://github.com/gp-pereira/refactorex). You can find the full
list of available refactorings in the [RefactorEx documentation](https://github.com/gp-pereira/refactorex?tab=readme-ov-file#available-refactorings).
