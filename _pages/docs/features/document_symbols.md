Document Symbols are similar to Workspace Symbols, but provide the symbols only for the currently open document.

They also have an intrinsic hierarchy that makes them useful for seeing the relationship between the document's modules, structs, and functions.

# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are the little "trail" you see at the top of the editor window.

# Document Outline

The outline shows you the hierarchy of the entire document, and allows you to jump to a specific symbol.
