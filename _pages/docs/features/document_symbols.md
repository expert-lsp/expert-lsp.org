Document Symbols show the structure of the current file, displaying modules, functions, and other definitions in a hierarchical outline.

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are the little "trail" you see at the top of the editor window.

## Document Outline

The outline shows you the hierarchy of the entire document, and allows you to jump to a specific symbol.

## Fuzzy Finding

Many editors allow you to "fuzzy find" the document symbols, similarly to how you would search for a file to open.

This screenshot demonstrates this using the [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) Neovim plugin.
