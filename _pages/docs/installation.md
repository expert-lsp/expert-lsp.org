You can easily install Expert with the [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) CLI and save it somewhere on your machine.

```shell
# Linux AMD64
$ gh release download nightly \
  --pattern *linux_amd64 \
  --output ~/.local/bin/expert \
  --clobber \
  --repo elixir-lang/expert

# Apple Silicon
$ gh release download nightly \
  --pattern *darwin_arm64 \
  --output ~/.local/bin/expert \
  --clobber \
  --repo elixir-lang/expert

$ chmod +x ~/.bin/expert
```

You can also manually download the executable from the [releases](https://github.com/elixir-lang/expert/releases) page.

## Source

> [!tip]
> 
> Expert uses [just](https://just.systems/man/en/). You can install it with your systems package manager.

Recipes for building from source are located in our [justfile](https://github.com/elixir-lang/expert/blob/main/justfile).

```shell
# Builds an executable for your OS and copies it into `~/.local/bin/`
$ just install
```

You can also skip cross-platform builds by running:

```shell
$ just release
```

And following the instructions in the output to point your editor to this build.
