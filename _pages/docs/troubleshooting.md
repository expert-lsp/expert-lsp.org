# Check the logs

When something isn't working as expected, the first step is to check the logs for any error messages or warnings.

## Log file

You can `tail` the log file that lives at `.expert/expert.log` in your project directory for the LS logs, or
the `.expert/project.log` for the project node logs.

These files contain the logs generated by Expert and its project nodes with timings.

## Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, the logs are available in the "Output" panel. You can access it by going to `View` > `Output`,
and then selecting `Expert` from the dropdown menu.

## Neovim

In Nvim, there are several ways to check the LSP logs.

If you happen to also have [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) installed, you can run `:LspLog`
and it will open a new tab with all of the LSP logs.

This is often hard to read, so you can use [output-panel.nvim](https://github.com/mhanberg/output-panel.nvim) that
closely resembles the Output Panel from Visual Studio Code.

# Open your editor from the terminal

To ensure the right environment variables are set(such as `SHELL` and `PATH`), open you editor using the terminal.

Expert will output the detected elixir executable path in the logs, so you can verify that it's using the correct one.
