Donations and sponsorships are handled by the [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation](https://erlef.org/).

If your company would like to donate, please reach out to Dan Janowski at [sponsor+expert@erlef.org](mailto:sponsor+expert@erlef.org).

## Objectives

The current priority is the inaugural [v0.1](https://github.com/elixir-lang/expert/milestone/1) release.

You can follow progress and see future milestones for the following releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/elixir-lang/expert/milestones).
